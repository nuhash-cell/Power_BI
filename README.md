# **Streamlining Manufacturing Data and KPI Reporting**

## **Project Overview**

This project involved **streamlining the manufacturing data pipeline** and **enhancing KPI reporting** for an affiliate of an **S&P 500 company**. As a **Data Analyst / Power BI Developer**, I focused on **providing actionable business insights** by transforming raw data into **visual dashboards** that facilitated **data-driven decision-making** and optimized **operational performance**.

## **Key Business Metrics and KPIs**
- **Production Efficiency**: Monitored as a **primary KPI** to track the effectiveness of production relative to established targets.
- **Scrap Rates**: A critical **cost-related metric** used to identify inefficiencies and drive cost-saving strategies.
- **Quality Performance**: Key **dimension** tracking quality at each stage (IQC, IPQC, OQC), ensuring product standards are met.

## **Key Contributions**

- **Data Consolidation and Reporting**: Integrated and structured data from multiple **disparate sources** into a centralized **Power BI dashboard**, providing real-time visibility into **critical production metrics**. This allowed stakeholders to:
  - Track **KPI performance** in real-time (e.g., production efficiency, scrap rates, quality control).
  - Leverage **business intelligence** to drive operational changes, improving **workflow efficiency** and minimizing downtime.

- **Real-Time Data Insights**: Built interactive dashboards that displayed **dynamic reports** on daily, weekly, and monthly targets, enabling **real-time tracking** of production goals. This provided managers with the ability to:
  - **Monitor progress** against **target KPIs** and adjust strategies quickly to ensure goals were met.
  - Make **data-informed adjustments** to **production workflows**, improving operational alignment and productivity.

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Performed **data cleaning** and **logic modeling** to ensure the **accuracy** and **integrity** of the data being reported. This ensured:
  - **Reliable tracking** of **employee performance** and **production line activities**, eliminating discrepancies.
  - Consistent and actionable data for decision-makers, enabling better forecasting and planning.

## **Dashboard Features and Insights**

The **Power BI dashboards** I developed included key features designed to empower operational decision-makers:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live updates on production metrics such as **efficiency rates**, **scrap percentages**, and **quality standards**, allowing stakeholders to take immediate corrective action.
  
- **Custom Data Visualizations**: Created tailored **charts, graphs**, and **heat maps** to highlight **trends**, **anomalies**, and **outliers** in production, helping teams make informed, proactive decisions.

- **Interactive Reporting**: Designed dashboards with **drill-down functionality**, enabling managers to explore data at multiple **granularity levels** (e.g., by time period, location, product type).

## **Impact and Business Value**

- **Optimized Operational Efficiency**: By providing real-time data visibility and allowing managers to make **data-driven adjustments**, I helped increase production efficiency by **5%** and reduced downtime.
  
- **Improved Decision-Making**: The dashboards facilitated quicker, more accurate decision-making by providing stakeholders with **actionable insights** tied to key metrics, aligning production with business goals.

- **Enhanced Data Integrity**: Through **data cleansing** and **standardized logic modeling**, I ensured that reporting was based on accurate and consistent data, which **improved reporting accuracy** and reduced errors in forecasting.
